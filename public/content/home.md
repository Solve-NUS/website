## What does Solve@NUS do?

Solve@NUS is a puzzle club dedicated to puzzle hunts, which are
events where teams work together to solve a series of puzzles. Our
sessions are spent solving puzzles, writing puzzles, or learning
about puzzles. We also participate in external puzzle hunts
together!

## What sort of puzzles do you do?

The puzzles we solve aren't just limited to your traditional
crosswords or sudokus: they can come in the form of audio tracks, a
text adventure game, a devious logic puzzle, or anything else under
the sun!
