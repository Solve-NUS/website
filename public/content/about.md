## What does Solve@NUS do?

Solve@NUS is a puzzle club dedicated to puzzle hunts! Puzzle hunts are events where teams work together to solve a series of puzzles. In a puzzle, you are given some information and have to extract a word or phrase (usually in English) as the answer, typically without direct instructions too. These puzzles typically come without direct instructions too.

Our sessions are spent solving puzzles, writing puzzles, or learning about puzzles. We also participate in external puzzle hunts together, including but not limited to Brown Puzzle Hunt, Puzzle Rojak, and Galactic Puzzle Hunt.

We aim to:

- Share our passion for solving and writing puzzles by gathering like-minded puzzlers through fun, engaging events
- Promote a schoolwide culture of thinking creatively to solve problems

## What sort of puzzles do you do?

The puzzles we solve aren't just limited to your traditional crosswords or sudokus: they can come in the form of audio tracks, a text adventure game, a devious logic puzzle, or anything else under the sun!

A typical puzzle set we run at our sessions consists of five puzzles: four feeder puzzles and one metapuzzle. A metapuzzle uses the answers of the feeder puzzles in the same set as the meta. Larger hunts consist of many more of such sets, which are used to measure progress.
